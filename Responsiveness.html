    <h1><bold>What is Responsive Design?</bold></h1>
        <p>Responsive design is a way to put together a website so that it automatically scales its content and elements to match the screen size on which it is viewed. These include devices such as different sized laptops, tablets, and phones. Instead of designing multiple websites for different screen sizes, you can design just one website that scales up or down automatically to match the device it’s being viewed on.</p>
        <article>Why is Responsive Design important?</article>
        <p>We live in a multi-screen society. Because of this, it’s important for your site to be viewable across as many devices as possible, because you never know what device someone will be using to view your website.In 2015, Google announced that mobile-friendliness would become a factor as to which sites would be shown in searches. This means that sites that were mobile-friendly would potentially lose exposure in search engine results. Whether you're a business or just a single entity, there is a reason that you have a website. Typically that reason is to gain exposure to someone or something.</p>
