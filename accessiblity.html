        <h2 tabindex="0">Accessibility</h2>

        <p>
            Accessibility is a necessity when creating a professional and functioning website. Having your website be accessable means that
            no matter a person's disability they should be able to navigate and use your website as well as any able-bodied person would.
            This includes but not limited to: making sure the website works well when using s screen reader, using colors that colorblind
            people can understand, and making use of certain attibutes to your tags so people with low motor skills can still navigate your website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below you will see more indepth ways to make your website accessible to all.

                <h3 tabindex="0">Use Proper Alt Tags on All of Your Images</h3>
                <p>
                    For those who are vision impaired and have to rely on a screen reader to navigate the website, alt tags are a must. <br />They are what are read
                    by the screen reader to the user. So make sure to use descriptive language in your alt, so people will understand what the image is. <br /> Also when
                    the image fails to load the alt is what is displayed instead. So there is no reason not to use it.

            <h3 tabindex="0">Give Your Links Descriptive Names</h3>
            <p>
                For those who rely on screen readers, links are seperate from the rest of the page. <br /> Without the context of surrounding words, links that just say,
                "Click me" have no meaning to those that use screen readers. <br /> Using short but descriptive words such as, "About Us" or "Studies on Women's Health",
                go a long way in terms of accessibilty.

                <h3 tabindex="0">Choosing Color Blind Friendly Colors</h3>
                <p>
                    With approximately <a href="http://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/" tabindex="0">300 million people in the world being color blind</a> choosing colors
                    that are friendly to color blind people isn't a choice. <br /> But with so many different types of colorblindness it would be hard to know of certain
                    if you are choosing the colors that are color blind friendly. <br /> Luckily, there are free online tools that you can use. Here is a website that
                    you can <a href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter" tabindex="0">upload a url to see it how a colorblind person would</a>. <br /> Or if your website isn't
                    online yet you can use this site to <a href="https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/" tabindex="0">
                        upload an image see it how a colorblind
                        person would
                    </a>.
                </p>

            <h3 tabindex="0">Make Sure The Website Can Be Navigated With a Keyboard.</h3>
            <p>
                Best way to check to see if your website can be navigated with your keyboard is to simply go to your website and start pressing tab.<br /> If you can't access
                parts of the website, neither can people with low motor skills. To make the website functionable with a keyboard use the tabindex tag. <br />Setting it to -1,
                makes it impossible to access with the tab key. Using 0 puts it in order of how the source code flows. <br />And using positive numbers puts the tab order as you set it.
                The average user will most likely never notice it. But those who need it will be greatful for it.
